# Yoshins-Palette-Flipper
An ultra simple Python script to flip .act files for use in Tile Molester, in conjunction with the Stitcher, to view/edit arcade accurate CPS1/2 tiles
Pretty simple to use, just have the script in the same folder as ya palettes and ya should be golden.
The recommended way to use it as follows
1) Find tiles using TM
2) Grab the palette, i suggest Palmod
3) Run the script to generate a "palname_flipped" version of the palette
R
Open that flipped palette in TM, and ya should be good
